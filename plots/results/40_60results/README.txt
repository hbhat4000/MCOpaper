The Python scirpts in this folder plot the test results for 
both naive and fixed CTMC models based on 40, 60 and 70 training games per team.

The scripts are train_naive.py and train_fixed.py

caltesttime_eachteam_naive.py and caltesttime_eachteam_fixed.py would plot the figure for test results on the spot. However, for the purpose to ensure matplotlib does not do weird things, test results are saved in #train_naive.mat and #train_fixed.mat  

NBA_timeplot.py plots the bar chart system took to fit the training set.
We time the script using time bash function.
